## Research Interests

Current work: biological networks, network control theory, discrete and ODE biological models<br>
Previous work: galaxy modeling, airglow physics, differential geometry and Lie theory

My work is about studying how feedback loops underlie multistability in network models of complex systems, and biomolecular systems in particular. I work on generalizing Boolean techniques to ODEs by considering how positive feedback loops in networks give rise to trap sets in phase space. I've used this framework to study attractor control of ODE models in various contexts, including the cell cycle regulation, pattern formation during embriogenesis, and immune cell signaling. I am also interested in studying Boolean networks. I am the lead developer of the Python library pystablemotifs, which enables fast attractor identification and control in Boolean networks. This library has allowed us to study attractor scaling in large random Boolean networks and to drive empirical Boolean networks to any desired attractor.

## Research Experience

### Postdoctoral Researcher 2022-Present, Binghamton University (SUNY) Dept. of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering
I am a current member of the Complex Adaptive Systems & Computational Intelligence ([CASCI](https://casci.binghamton.edu/casci.php)) laboratory lead by Professor Luis Rocha. I work on developing new tools and algorithms for analyzing complex networks in a variety of domains, including social media, biomedical data, and systems biology.

### Graduate Research Assistant 2016–2022, Pennsylvania State University Dept. of Physics
Developing new network control approaches that generalize methods for discrete dynamics to continuous ODE network
models in collaboration with Professor Réka Albert. Apply network control theory to biological network models to better
understand decision mechanisms in cellular systems, identify potential drug targets, and predict results of biological
experiments.


### Graduate Research Assistant 2014-2016, Utah State University Dept. of Mathematics
Classification of homogeneous space-times according to their symmetries as part of Master’s Thesis advised by Professor
Ian Anderson and Professor Charles Torre. Devised a new coordinate-free classification scheme for Lie algebras of a
certain type relevant to homogeneous solutions to the Einstein equations and implemented the classification using the
DifferentialGeometry package of the computer algebra system Maple.


### Undergraduate Researcher, 2011-2014, Utah State University Dept. of Electrical Engineering

Data validation for the SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) satellite instru-
ment in collaboration with Professor Gene Ware and Professor Doran Baker. Analyzed SABER data, and maintained
the USU copy of the database. Focused on perceived bifurcation of hydroxyl airglow layer in the mesosphere.
Undergraduate Research Fellow, 2010-2014, Utah State University Dept. of Physics
Examining bias in galaxy catalogs due to galaxy geometry in collaboration with Professor Shane Larson as part of USU’s
Undergraduate Research Fellowship. Wrote computer simulations of galaxy surface brightness. Performed statistical
analyses of galaxy catalogs to search for possible indications of observation bias.
